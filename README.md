# ðŸ”¤ LeetCode 49: Group Anagrams â€“ Hashing & Sorting Solution

This repository contains a Python solution to **LeetCode Problem 49: Group Anagrams**, where the goal is to group strings that are anagrams of each other.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Summary

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the strings that are **anagrams** of each other.

Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in any order.

### Example:
```python
Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```
## ðŸ“Š Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n * k log k)
- n = number of strings
- k = average length of each string (due to sorting)

Space Complexity: O(n * k)
- For storing grouped anagrams
